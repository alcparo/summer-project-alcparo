This software has been developed on MacOSX 10.8.5, R version 2.15.3, but should run on several other operating systems and R versions.

reliability_ecml2014final.pdf is the paper which was submitted to ECML 2014
run.sh contains examples on how to run the code in ecml14wang.r and ecml14real.r
ecml14wang.r contains code to run on the synthetic dataset
ecml14real.r contains code to run on UCI datasets
ecml14func.r contains the function definitions that are used by ecml14real.r and ecml14wang.r
bch_n15_k5_t3_sum7_dist8_t.csv and bch_n7_k4_t1_sum3_dist4_t.csv contain error correcting code matrices
The rest of the files are UCI datasets: page-blocks.arff segment.arff shuttle.tst vehicle.arff yeast.arff
